# CAPSTONE_2
Developed biodegradable cutlery and medium-density fibreboards using rice husk and stubble as sustainable alternatives to plastic and wood.
Project Summary:
Led the design and fabrication of sustainable medium-density fiberboards (MDF) and biodegradable cutlery using agricultural residues—primarily rice husk and stubble—as eco-friendly alternatives to conventional wood-based composites and plastics. The project addressed the dual challenge of stubble burning and plastic pollution by valorizing agro-waste into value-added, compostable products suitable for furniture, construction, and food service applications.

Key Responsibilities and Achievements:

Raw Material Sourcing & Processing: Collaborated with local farmers to source rice husk and stubble, ensuring a sustainable supply chain. Developed protocols for cleaning, grinding, and drying to optimize fiber quality for composite manufacturing.

Material Formulation: Experimented with a range of natural (starch, carboxymethyl cellulose, acacia gum, citric acid, glycerine) and synthetic (epoxy resin) adhesives. Designed and tested multiple composite formulations to balance strength, flexibility, and biodegradability.

Product Development:

Cutlery: Developed and optimized biodegradable cutlery prototypes, improving mechanical integrity and water resistance through binder selection and surface coatings (e.g., aloe vera gel).

Fiberboards: Fabricated MDF samples with both natural and hybrid binder systems. Achieved significant improvements in strength and dimensional stability using epoxy resin, with best-performing boards reaching densities up to 1062 kg/m³ and modulus values exceeding 800 MPa.

Process Engineering: Utilized accessible tools (kitchen grinder, electric kettle, hot press, hot air oven) to demonstrate feasibility in low-resource settings. Developed custom molds and optimized hot-pressing and curing protocols to enhance product consistency and quality.

Mechanical Testing & Validation: Conducted rigorous mechanical testing (tensile, three-point bending) in accordance with ASTM D1037 standards. Analyzed results to inform iterative design improvements and validate product suitability for structural and disposable applications.

Sustainability Impact: Demonstrated a scalable solution for reducing stubble burning and associated air pollution, while providing farmers with alternative income streams. Products aligned with circular economy principles and offer a viable path toward greener manufacturing and reduced plastic use.

Documentation & Reporting: Compiled comprehensive technical documentation, including process flows, material trials, test results, and recommendations for future development (e.g., advanced biopolymers, nano-reinforcement, process automation).

Skills Demonstrated:
Sustainable product design, materials engineering, experimental optimization, mechanical testing, teamwork, process documentation, and project management.
